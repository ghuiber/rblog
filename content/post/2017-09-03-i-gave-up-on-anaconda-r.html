<p>In March of this year I decided to run R and RStudio from inside an Anaconda installation as described <a href="https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language?utm_source=housefile&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=onboarding_cheat_sheet&amp;mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRneE9UUmlaREV6WVRoaSIsInQiOiJmVEF2S1l0NHZsQSs3enM4VlNSOW5MTVF4aEE3eVNVQ3JhXC9WSFZTMzJGa1Q3UlJaNURJd3Zud0FsTnR6NjRhdnRMeDBmUzR3Q0pDRWM4SVpBMDAyQUo0eVU0RXoxS2RDK2xuSWlPckQ0bkN3UTBOSEF2dHpZaE9ER2RBMEJZYWoifQ%3D%3D#">here</a>. That experiment is over. Two annoyances cropped up:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>My Anaconda RStudio wouldn’t shut down a running Shiny app. I reported this in all the obvious places: <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115006375927-Shiny-apps-and-dashboards-won-t-stop">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1732">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44008205/rstudio-behaves-in-unexpected-ways-in-anaconda">here</a>. Evidently, it’s not a big enough problem to be worth anybody’s trouble. That is fine. In retrospect, it wasn’t that big a deal for me either.</li>
<li>This one is though: the latest update of the conda kit (to R 3.4.1 and RStudio 1.0.153) brought up the <code>Error in tools::startDynamicHelp() : internet routines cannot be loaded</code> message at launch time. This means that you won’t get online R help. Any attempt to <code>??</code> anything will repeat this same message.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I’m back to a <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">stock RStudio</a> and a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">stock R</a> downloaded as Mac OS X binaries. This pairing works as expected. I kept Anaconda because I may still nose around Python 3 at some point. If you do this and keep your Anaconda R, you will have to direct RStudio to the <code>/usr/local/bin/R</code> explicitly.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to do this. One is indirectly explained <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38534383/how-to-set-up-conda-installed-r-for-use-with-rstudio">here</a> (it actually shows how to point RStudio to an Anaconda R but the recipe <code>launchctl setenv RSTUDIO_WHICH_R</code> can be changed to suit).</p>
<p>You could also simply push the Anaconda stuff to the back of the path; it puts itself at the front when you install Anaconda by writing a one-line <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file that says</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=&quot;/Users/&lt;YOURUSERNAME&gt;/anaconda3/bin:$PATH&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can just edit that line to reverse the order and save over:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=&quot;$PATH:/Users/&lt;YOURUSERNAME&gt;/anaconda3/bin&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Or you could decide that you don’t need two R’s. You can get rid of the one under Anaconda with <code>conda remove r-essentials</code> and then <code>conda clean</code>. That is what I did.</p>
