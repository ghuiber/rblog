I live in San Francisco now, so I do data science in the fog. I moved here from Durham, NC. There I was noodling in the data stream. I'm an immigrant. We adapt or leave.

I am trying out [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) with the hope that it will be easier to write this way: I can do it straight from RStudio with math and R code -- should the need come up -- treated as first-class citizens.
